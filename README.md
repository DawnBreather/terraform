# terraform usage

I have uploaded managing AWS via terraform. However, I would like to use other providers which terraform support in future.

First of all, you should clone this repo to your local machine. I provided modules with simple examples.    

## Plan
```terraform plan``` or ```terraform plan -var-file terraform.tfvars``` 

## Apply
```terraform apply``` or ```terraform apply -var-file terraform.tfvars```

## Destroy
```terraform destroy``` or ```terraform destroy -var-file terraform.tfvars```
